# 🚀 Machine Learning Week Project: Predictive Modeling and Deployment

## 📢 Announcement
Welcome to the Machine Learning Week project! In this project, you’ll apply machine learning to solve a real-world problem using a public dataset. Your goal is to build, evaluate, and deploy an ML model.

## 📝 Deliverables
- **Python Notebooks**: Data collection, cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.
- **Deployment**: 
    - Create a REST API using FastAPI or Flask.
    - Build a frontend using Streamlit.
    - Deploy both the Streamlit and the API.
- **Data**: Raw and cleaned datasets.
- **Presentation**: A final presentation summarizing your project (details below).
- **Requirements file**: List of dependencies for the project.
- **README**: Project overview and instructions.

1. **Data Handling**:
   - Document your data collection and cleaning processes clearly. Explain how raw data is transformed into a usable format.
   - Handle missing values and outliers carefully; they can impact model performance.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Choose a model that is well-suited for the task and ensure that you evaluate it thoroughly (cross-validation, performance metrics, etc.).
   - Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve results.

3. **Deployment**:
   - If deploying, ensure the model can serve predictions efficiently. Use frameworks like Streamlit or Flask for a simple interface.
   - Test the deployment in real scenarios for robustness.

4. **Presentation**:
   - Keep your slides concise, focusing on the key problem, approach, and results.
   - Use visuals like charts, graphs, and model performance metrics to back up your conclusions.
5. **Emphasize collaboration and version control through GitHub.**
